**The goal**: in this project, we provided users with a new booking system for dental appointments, aiming to replace 
              the old, traditional method of calling voicemails. Specifically, it manages the ability to schedule 
              appointments via a mobile device, both in a Web Application and a PWA.

**The code structure**: we worked in various languages, including graphics-related languages like HTML or CSS, or 
                        implementation-related languages like JS, JSON, and Flask. Furthermore, with the help of a 
                        relational database, we were able to eliminate the volatility of mobile phone calls to book an 
                        appointment, since we make the booking process permanent until it's completed (or canceled).

**How to do it**: we define the booking option for three types of dentists: physicians, surgeons, and hygienists. 
                  Furthermore, for each of them, we provide the option to select one of the visit types, i.e., the one 
                  the user needs. They can choose the most suitable specialist, depending on availability.

**Access method**: to access the system, you will need to login. Afterward, all actions will be constantly monitored 
                   for the benefit of the specific user.
